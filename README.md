# MLFamilyAndHaskellExamples

This repository gets a user simultaneously up and running on basic examples of SML, Ocaml, Fsharp, and Haskell.

Then only necessary dependency here is the nix package manager, which can be installed using: 

```curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh```. 

There are two directories of examples: ./Test and ./Factorial. Each can be run by cd'ing into the directory and running the ./run executable.

I have some surface level comparisons in ./notes.txt.
